# Portfolio

A simple portfolio page for showing off my projects. Check it out at https://kriskoishigawa.com/.

This page is served with [GitHub Pages](https://scissorsneedfoodtoo.github.io/portfolio/), and reversed proxied with NGINX on a small DigitalOcean Droplet used to test and host small applications.
